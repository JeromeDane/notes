# Skyrim Mods

My personal favorite Skyrim tools and mods. Some of these are resource intensive, and won't be good for older machines. I'll try to mark which ones fall in this category. Some are not safe for work (nsfw) and feature nudity or other adult content. If this bothers you, don't install these mods ... or grow up. Either way.

## Essential Tools

* [Mod Organizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/)
* [Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE)](http://skse.silverlock.org/) - Required for many of the best mods

## User Interface

* [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863/) - Much better inventory management & filtering
* [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/) - Better character creation tools
* [Better MessageBox Controlls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28170/) - Control dialog boxes with the keyboard
* [QuickLook](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73096) - Quick loot interface like Fallout 4
* [Vendor Sale Delay - GONE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34224/) - Access vendor interface before they finish talking
* [A Quality World Map](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4929/)
* [Unread Books Glow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10012/) - Easily see books you haven't read and which ones grant skill points

## Graphics / Models

* [Static Mesh Improvement Mod - SMIM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8655/) - Higer polygon counts all around
* [Ruins Clutter Improved](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14227/)
* [RealVision END](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/30936/) - Modernize graphics with shaders and lighting
* [NobleSkyrimMod HD-2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/) - Great high-res textures for modern PCs

## Patches/Fixes

* [Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71214/) - Fix things Bathesda missed

* [Crash Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72725/) - Essential, especially when modding

## Character Enhancements

* [DIMONIZED UNP female body](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/6709/) - [nsfw] Female bodies and skin textures that look real without being rediculous
* [Better Males](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2488/) - [nsfw] More realistic male bodies and textures that don't turn them all into Fabio
* [The Eyed of Beauty](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/13722/) - Realistic eyes
