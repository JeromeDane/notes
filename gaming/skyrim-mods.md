# Skyrim Mods

My personal favorite Skyrim tools and mods. Some are resource intensive, and won't be good for older machines. These are marked with `taxing`. Some are not very lore frieldly, and are marked with `nlf`. Some are not safe for work (feature nudity or other adult content), and are marked with `nsfw`. If this bothers you, don't install these mods... or grow up.

If you have any suggestions for this list [ping me on twitter](https://twitter.com/JeromeDane) or something. This list is weak when it comes to gender equality and a female perspective, so I'd love to get suggestions on that front.

## Gender Swaps

If you have male swaps to suggest please [let me know](https://twitter.com/JeromeDane).

* [Female Ulfric](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71864/) `nlf` - Fully voiced female [Ulfric](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Ulfric_Stormcloak_(Skyrim)). A bit too young. Should have been middle-aged and less sensual.
* [Female Heimskr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71396/) `nlf` - Fully voiced [Heimskr](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Heimskr) that preaches feminism instead of Talos worship
* [Female Cicero](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/66408/) `nlf` `nsfw` - Fully, irritatingly voiced, female [Cicero](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Cicero). I hesitated to include this due to the blantant cleavage and ... ugh... that voice... but Cicero is so irritating in the original version it's nice to have options.
* [All Female Guards](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/14039/) `nlf` - Either a male fantasy, or an overturning of the patriarchy depending on your perspective
* [Feminized Level Lists](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22710/) `nlf` - All female oponents (bandits, etc)

## Cheats

* [Helmet Toggle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/22765/) - Great if you want to see your character's head but still want the armor/stat bonus from headdgear.
* [Dangerous Spell Comments Removed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57302/) `nlf` - Don't tell me to put my spells away!
* [Sneak at Run Spead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54049/) `nlf` - For stealth character runs that don't take twice as long to play.
* [No Friendly Fire Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/84949/) `nlf` - Don't hurt your allies
